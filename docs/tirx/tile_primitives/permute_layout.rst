permute_layout
==============

``permute_layout`` rearranges a warp's data from a source ``TileLayout`` to a
destination one — typically an in-place transpose. CUDA and MACA register
separate implementations because their warp widths and memory instructions
differ. Both stage every lane's values in registers and use a barrier between
the load and store phases, so source and destination may alias.

The CUDA variant (``warp_xor_swizzle``) uses Warp32 and an optional PTX shared
memory path. Source:
``python/tvm/backend/cuda/tile_primitive/permute_layout/warp_xor_swizzle.py``.

MACA variants
-------------

MACA registers two variants: ``wave64_xor`` (priority 40) and
``wave64_generic`` (priority 10). Both require warp scope, a one-dimensional
full Wave64 lane range ``[0, 64)``, equal static slice extents, plain
``TileLayout`` objects, and bijective sliced layouts. Scalar element widths of
1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes are supported. Vector elements and 16-byte scalar
elements are rejected explicitly.

For volume ``V``, the active lane count is
``min(64, next_power_of_two(V))`` and each lane gets
``ceil(V / active_lanes)`` register slots. Every memory access is guarded by
``lane_id < active_lanes`` and ``flat < V``, so non-power-of-two volumes are
valid. ``wave64_xor`` is an optimization for 4-byte scalar data only. Automatic
selection requires shared/shared operands, ``slots <= 32``, and a certified
nonzero XOR bit count ``k`` that is bank-free for both layouts. The generic
variant handles every other valid storage scope and every valid layout for
which that schedule is unavailable.

Every variant performs complete register loads, an unconditional
``T.maca.warp_sync()``, complete stores, and a second unconditional barrier
across all 64 lanes. This ordering supports aliasing views. The implementation
uses ordinary typed buffer accesses and does not use PTX, inline assembly,
TCGEN05, TMA, tensor-memory, or unverified BSM permutation intrinsics.

What it accepts
---------------

The implementation first builds a common permutation plan:

.. code-block:: python

    if sctx.scope_kind != "warp":                  return "scope is not 'warp'"
    if "threadIdx.y" in launch or "threadIdx.z" in launch: return "multi-dim threadIdx"
    if src_buf.dtype != dst_buf.dtype:             return "dtype mismatch"
    if src_ext_i != dst_ext_i:                     return "extent mismatch"
    if dtype.lanes != 1:                            return "vector elements are not supported"
    if dtype_bytes not in (1, 2, 4, 8):             return "unsupported scalar element width"
    if not isinstance(src_buf.layout, TileLayout): return "src not a plain TileLayout"
    if not isinstance(dst_buf.layout, TileLayout): return "dst not a plain TileLayout"
    # + layouts must slice, regroup, and define bijections on the slice
    # + volume is nonzero and both layouts are bijections
    # Variant-specific XOR checks only select an optimization.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 78

   * - Property
     - Requirement
   * - target / scope / priority
     - ``maca``; **warp** scope only; ``wave64_xor`` priority 40 and
       ``wave64_generic`` priority 10
   * - operands
     - equal dtype, equal (compile-time) extents; both plain ``TileLayout`` (no
       swizzle wrapper); scalar dtype byte width ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}; vector and
       16-byte scalar elements are rejected; ordinary typed buffer loads and
       stores
   * - launch / volume
     - one-dimensional full Wave64; any nonzero static slice volume
   * - layout mapping
     - after slicing and regrouping, source and destination describe the same
       iteration extents and each is a bijection on the slice
   * - bank-freedom
     - automatic XOR selection is shared/shared-only, requires ``slots <= 32``
       and a nonzero certified ``k``; ``wave64_generic`` remains eligible for
       all valid scopes and layouts

Demonstration program
----------------------

A warp transposes the inner ``4×32`` block of a scale-factor tile — source layout
strides ``(…, 32, 1)``, destination ``(…, 1, 4)`` — for two pipeline stages (the
canonical SF-transpose, from ``test_permute_layout.py``):

.. code-block:: python

    pipe, blk, dtype = 2, 128, "float32"; high = 1
    shape = (pipe, high, 4, 32)
    pre  = TileLayout(S[shape : (blk, 128, 32, 1)])   # source
    post = TileLayout(S[shape : (blk, 128, 1, 4)])    # destination (4↔32 transposed)

    @Tx.prim_func
    def f(A: Tx.handle, B: Tx.handle):
        A_buf = Tx.match_buffer(A, shape, dtype, layout=pre)
        B_buf = Tx.match_buffer(B, shape, dtype, layout=post)
        Tx.device_entry(); Tx.cta_id([1]); Tx.warp_id([1]); Tx.lane_id([64])
        for s in Tx.serial(0, pipe):
            Tx.tile.warp.permute_layout(B_buf[s, 0:1, 0:4, 0:32], A_buf[s, 0:1, 0:4, 0:32])

Algorithm
---------

**1. Align the two layouts.** Both layouts are sliced to the region and
canonicalized; if their shards differ in structure (a linear layout collapses to 1-D
under canon, a transposed one keeps its multi-dim shape) the source is regrouped to
the destination's shape. From the destination shard come the iteration ``extent``
and the per-side strides ``src_str`` / ``dst_str``. The plan computes
``active_lanes`` and ``slots = ceil(volume / active_lanes)``.

**2. Choose a variant.** ``wave64_xor`` simulates both 32-lane service
batches and chooses the smallest nonzero conflict-free XOR schedule. The
certification search is limited to power-of-two ``slots`` in ``1..32`` and
checks both the source and destination shared-memory bank patterns. Automatic
XOR selection is currently limited to shared/shared operands. XOR only changes
register-slot order, so the transform is mathematically valid for mixed
storage too; the mixed-storage policy is deferred until the shared operand's
bank behavior and the non-shared operand's access cost have been measured.
When the policy declines, ``wave64_generic`` handles the valid plan.

**3. Emit two local-staged phases.** Each lane reads its ``slots`` elements through
the source layout into a local temporary (the swizzle permutes which slot holds
which iteration), a ``warp_sync`` follows, then the elements are written back through the
destination layout:

.. code-block:: python

    regs = Tx.alloc_buffer((slots,), dtype, scope="local")
    for r in Tx.unroll(0, slots):
        slot = r ^ (((lane_id & 31) >> shift) & mask)  # zero for generic
        flat = lane_id + slot * active_lanes
        if lane_id < active_lanes and flat < volume:
            regs[r] = src_buf[project(decompose(flat, extent), src_st)]
    Tx.maca.warp_sync()
    for r in Tx.unroll(0, slots):
        slot = r ^ (((lane_id & 31) >> shift) & mask)
        flat = lane_id + slot * active_lanes
        if lane_id < active_lanes and flat < volume:
            dst_buf[project(decompose(flat, extent), dst_st)] = regs[r]
    Tx.maca.warp_sync()

CUDA reference TIRx IR
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    regs[r] = A_buf[s*128 + (r ^ ((tx >> 3) & 3)) % 4 * 32 + tx]   # phase 1 (src order)
    Tx.cuda.warp_sync()
    B_buf[s*128 + tx * 4 + (r ^ ((tx >> 3) & 3)) % 4] = regs[r]    # phase 2 (dst order)
    Tx.cuda.warp_sync()

CUDA reference source
---------------------

.. code-block:: c++

    alignas(64) float regs_ptr[4];
    regs_ptr[0] = A_buf_ptr[(s*128) + (((0 ^ ((threadIdx.x >> 3) & 3)) & 3) * 32) + threadIdx.x];
    regs_ptr[1] = A_buf_ptr[(s*128) + (((1 ^ ((threadIdx.x >> 3) & 3)) & 3) * 32) + threadIdx.x];
    regs_ptr[2] = A_buf_ptr[(s*128) + (((2 ^ ((threadIdx.x >> 3) & 3)) & 3) * 32) + threadIdx.x];
    regs_ptr[3] = A_buf_ptr[(s*128) + (((3 ^ ((threadIdx.x >> 3) & 3)) & 3) * 32) + threadIdx.x];
    __syncwarp();
    // ... 4 transposed writes into B_buf_ptr, then __syncwarp();

Each lane owns column ``threadIdx.x`` and stages its 4 rows through ``regs``; the
``(threadIdx.x >> 3)`` XOR rotates the register order per lane-group of 8 so the
write phase hits distinct banks and transposes the ``4×32`` block for every
pipeline stage.

MACA vector note
----------------

Tested shared-memory vector accesses can preserve a shared/shared permutation,
but vector enablement is deferred. The MACA global-to-shared ``vec_auto`` copy
path needs a separate fix for full vector element widths, followed by
end-to-end device tests for default copies and permutation views. Until that
work is complete, vector elements remain outside the ``permute_layout``
dispatcher contract.

How inputs change the algorithm
-------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 72

   * - input
     - effect
   * - layout strides (the permutation)
     - define ``extent`` / ``src_str`` / ``dst_str`` and hence slot indexing and the
       per-element index math (the transpose pattern)
   * - dtype byte width
     - feeds the bank simulation in ``_choose_xor_k`` for the optional 4-byte
       XOR path; unsupported XOR simply falls through to ``wave64_generic``
   * - chosen ``k``
     - sets ``shift`` / ``mask`` of the XOR swizzle; automatic XOR requires
       ``k > 0`` (``k = 0`` is the unswizzled order)
   * - active lanes / slots
     - active lanes are ``min(64, next_power_of_two(volume))`` and slots are
       ``ceil(volume / active_lanes)``; non-power-of-two slots are valid for
       the generic path, while automatic XOR is certified only for
       ``slots <= 32``
